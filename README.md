To get the application running locally:
* Clone this repo
* npm install to install all required dependencies
* npm start to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)

More specifically; 
* $git clone https://github.com/philipkantola/wki_sample
* $cd wki_sample
* $npm install
* $npm start

App.js works as a wrapper, rendering all the other components, which are visible or not depending on the state of the site. (where you as a user are navigating).
